I designed the PCB described in a course I took on the Udemy platform in Februrary 2023. With this course, I designed a 3-phase motor driver board by following the instructions in the course.

In this motor driver circuit, Atmega328P is used as the main microcontroller. MOSFETs are used to drive each phase of the motor. There is a separate driver circuit for each phase. By controlling the phases correctly, the rotational movement of the motor can be achieved. The motor driver integrated circuit uses the signals from the microcontroller to amplify the signals to turn the MOSFETs on and off at the right time. Thus, the correct power transmission is provided to the phases of the motor.
